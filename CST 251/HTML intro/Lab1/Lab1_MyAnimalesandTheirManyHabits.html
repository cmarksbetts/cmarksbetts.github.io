 <h1>My Animals and Their Many Habits</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2> - Off to Get the New Pack!</h2>
 <div> Whenever my Mom and I adopt animals we adopt them all together. Our last pack was two dogs (Zeena (golden retriever and pit bull mix) and Buddy (Rotwieler mutt)) and two cats (Katerina (tabby) and Bageera (black)). That  pack lived on and were rascals for twenty years, they predated me and passed away around Christmas one year after the other from when I was twelve till I was fifteen. On August 28th, 2018 my mom and I heard on the radio of the <a href="https://www.sfspca.org/" target="_blank"> San Francisco SPCA</a> hosting a <strong> "Clear the Shelters Day!"</strong> where all of the animals were free. So we packed up and went off to get our new pack!</div>
<hr> <!-- New section -->

 <h3> - <u>Pidge</u></h3>
 <!-- Include image of Pidge with her paws under her little chin -->

 <ul><li><div>The first example will be my cat Pidge. When we adopted her she was one of the biggest kittens in the cat section of the shelter, she looked close to being a year old. When we first walked in she was nervous, but she eventually came and cuddled on my lap. She is the only adoptee we had to change the name of, her name was supposed to be Janet, Mom and I chaged her name to Pidge due to the  fact that when she purrs she coos like a pidgeon. </div></li></ul>

 <ul><li><div>Some of Pidge's favorite activities are roaming outside, cuddling, and sleeping.</div></li></ul>
 <!-- Start of List of Pidge's favorite activities -->
 <ol><li><div>Pidge just like her sister Shuri are outdoor kitties. They get let out into the backyeard every morning right after breakfast at 6:00am. Pidge always goes across the street to our neighbor's yard. My mom and I can not figure out why she loves going over there so much, but we are pretty sure it has to do with her overgrown yard. In our area where overgrown gardens are there are snakes, mice, and humming birds. All of Pidge's favorite prey. Once a week without fail Pidge will bring home a trophy for Mom and I to clean up. She has really good hunting instincts.</div></li>
  <li><div>Pidge's love for cuddling and sleep are very much intertwinesd, she uses up a lot of energy and calories when outside so when she comes inside she loves to cuddle up with either one of the other animals or one of us humans if we are home. I have clocked her in for sleeping on average up to 14 hours per day.</div></li>

 <h3> - <u>Rosie</u></h3>
 <!-- Include image of Rose after the dog park w/ big tung <img src=""alt=>  -->
 <ul><li><div>The second example will be my dog Rose, nickname Rosie. When we adopted her they estimated that she was about 1 year old. The reason she was brought into the shelter is because she was hit by a car and had to get surgery. When we first saw the plackard outside of her kennel it said her name was Rose due to her being a delicate flower. All we saw outside of her kennel was this lonely ball of fur in the corner of the kennel with a cone of shame on her head. She was a little ray of sunshine who immedielty licked my mom and me. She was so excited to meet up infact that she excite peed in her kennel. She has not grown out of that habbit even though it has been years. She had extreme PTSD of the road and was scared of things such as loud noises, doors, and squeaky toys. It has been a long time since then and Rosie is a sweet and confident puppy now!</div></li></ul>
 <!-- Image of Rose with the cone of shame right after we adopted her -->
 <ul><li><div>Some of Rosie's favorite activities are sunbathing, joyriding, and playing tag with our kitties. </div></li></ul>
  <!-- Start of List of Rose's favorite activities -->
 <ol><li><div> Rosie loves the sun so much that her eye (with less fur) gets sun burnt so much that we have to lure her back inside with treats.</div></li>
 <li><div> After a lot of training we got Rose used to the road and cars again, now she loves long rides where she can smell the fresh sea air. When I first got my driver's licence her and I went driving around San Francisco, Mill Valley, San Rafael, Tiburoun, and Strawberry. We concluded that day with a sunset walk at Muir Beach, we were in that car for a total of eight hours, just enjoying the feeling of driving and freedom together.</div></li>
 <li><div>Since Rosie is part Boarder Collie she instinctually wants to herd animals. The most convient animals for her to herd just happen to be our two kitties <em> Pidge</em> and <em>Shuri</em>. Rose hasn't figured out yet (after years of a fruitless chase) that the cats will always be faster than her and will <strong>always</strong> be able to get to places that she can't. This habit Rose loves to do has been proven to be useful, from getting the cats to stop clawing the couch, area rugs, and to break up their fights on our behalf. </div></li>

 <h3> - <u>Shuri</u></h3>
 <!-- Include image of Shuri On Mom's computer -->
 <ul><li><div>The last example will be Shuri. When my mom and I were going to the shelter we were planning on just getting two animals, one dog and one cat. But at the ASPCA cat shelter we saw these signs everywhere that said <strong>"They go better in Pairs!"</strong> with a whole list of reasons as to why cats go better in pairs. My mom and I were able to ignore these signs pretty easily until we were inside of Pidge's glass box (her kennel). We were playing with baby Pidge and on the other side of the glass there was this baby black cat trying to get Pidge's tail through the glass. My mom and I found her super funny and went over to say hi. When my Mom and I went over to Shuri's kennel we saw a picture outside of her kennel explaining that due to the popularity of the hit film <em>Black Panther</em> the shelter saw a 70% increase of the adoption of their black cats, so they named her "Shuri" in hopes of her getting adopted. When we interacted with her we realized Shuri was (and still is) a little firecracker, she was super energetic and playful bouncing all over her glass kennel. My mom and I decided we were going to break our rule on only two animals and get Shuri as well. </div></li></ul>
 <!-- Image of Shuri on Mom's bed with her tung sticking out -->
 <ul><li><div>Some of Shuri's favorite activities are hanging out with the neighbors, knocking things over, and sleeping.</div></li></ul>
 <!-- Start of list of Shuri's favorite activities -->
 <ol><li><div>When we let the cats outside Pidge runs off to the neighbors across the street and Shuri runns off to our nextdoor neightbor Tish's house. Tish doesn't mind Shuri hanging out in her yard, she grows fruit and had a rat problem, so she welcome's Shuri scaring off the rodents who want to eat her crop.</div></li>
  <li><div>Shuri is the trouble maker amungst the pack of sisters. Everyday when mom and I come home we will find something knocked over. Most commonly the cat's glass of water on the laundry machine. I guess that is Shuri's way of saying she prefers the dog's water. We all know cat's prefer to use things that are not theirs.</div></li>
<li><div>Shuri is the only one in the house that can take Pidge's record for the longest sleeper in the house. Shuri sleeps, on average, 18 hours a day, but don't you worry if we forget to but the animas to bed at night she will make her presence known at 3:00am on the dot.</div></li>
